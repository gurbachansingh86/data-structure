/**
 *
 *  In this article, we will discuss the types of questions based on hashing.
 *  Before understanding this, you should have idea about hashing, hash function, open addressing and chaining techniques (see: Introduction, Separate chaining, Open addressing).
 *
 * These are some key points in hashing:
 *
 * The purpose of hashing is to achieve search, insert and delete complexity to O(1).
 * Hash function is designed to distribute keys uniformly over the hash table.
 * Load factor α in hash table can be defined as number of slots in hash table to number of keys to be inserted.
 * For open addressing, load factor α is always less than one.
 * The complexity of insertion, deletion and searching using open addressing is 1/(1-α).
 * The complexity of insertion, deletion and searching using chaining method is (1+α).
